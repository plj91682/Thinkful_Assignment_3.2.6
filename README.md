### Drill - Exercises in Bayes' Rule

Calculate the probability that the test will:

* Be positive
* Correctly diagnose a sufferer of Thripshaw's
* Correctly identify a non-sufferer of Thripshaw's
* Misclassify the person

__Given Facts__


-  98% -> (for sufferers) The test Accuracy Rate: The test confirms you *__Do Have__* the condition
-   2% -> (for sufferers) The test Error Rate: The test *__incorrectly__* confirms you don't have the condition
-  10% -> (for non-sufferers) The test Error Rate: the test *__incorrectly__* confirms you Do Have the condition 
-  90% -> (for non-sufferers) The test Accuracy Rate: the test confirms you *__Don't Have__* the condition
- 0.5% -> The rate the general population has the condition

__Bayes Rule__

P(A|B) = (Pr(B|A)Pr(A)) / (Pr(B|A)Pr(A)+Pr(B|~A)Pr(~A))

1. Be positive
     - 
     - f

2. Correctly diagnose a sufferer of Thripshaw's
3. Correctly identify a non-sufferer of Thripshaw's
4. Misclassify the person
